# Exercise 1:
# Write recursive function natural_reverse(n) which takes a natural number n 
# and returns the natural number whose digits are the digits of n in reverse order.
# Examples:
# natural_reverse(12345) = 54321
# natural_reverse(12300) = 321
# Note: usage of temporary array is disallowed.



# Exercise 2:
# Write recursive function binary_to_decimal(binary_string) which takes a binary string
# and returns the decimal number equivalent of that binary.
# The binary string's most significant bit is the leftmost one.
# Note: usage of substring is allowed but splitting string into array is not.
# Examples:
# binary_to_decimal("101") = 5
# binary_to_decimal("1") = 1
# binary_to_decimal("001001") = 9
